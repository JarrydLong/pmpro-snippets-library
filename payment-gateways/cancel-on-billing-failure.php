 * 
 * This code recipe cancels a user's membership when a recurring payment fails. This is useful for gateways like Authorize.net that do not automatically cancel subscriptions when a payment fails.
 * Edit your billing failure email template to mention that users are cancelled upon failure. 
 * Note: This cancels on the first failure. To cancel only when cancelling at Stripe, see this gist: https://gist.github.com/strangerstudios/5093710	
 *
 * You can add this recipe to your site by creating a custom plugin
 * or using the Code Snippets plugin available for free in the WordPress repository.
 * Read this companion article for step-by-step directions on either method.
