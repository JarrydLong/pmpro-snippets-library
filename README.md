# Snippets Library for Paid Memberships Pro and related Add Ons

We are aiming to collect all of the most useful Gists and Snippets here in one place.

A few of the benefits of this collection will be:

* **Quality Assurance:** Each snippet will get code reviewed for quality and compatibility
* **Access:** Easy to search via GitHub (or locally)
* **Offline Access:** Easy to checkout this repo locally by the team as needed
* **Maintainability:** One place to update as changes are needed going forward for any snippet (not stuck on any one GitHub user account)

## Submitting new snippets or changes

2. Just go to the folder (or create a new path) for where you want to add/change a snippet.
3. Create a fork and submit Pull Fequest with your snippet work.
4. The PR will be code reviewed.
5. In the mean time, you can provide customers with your own Gist URL of the snippet.
6. After PR is approved, the snippet will be merged.
7. Now the snippet is ready for inclusion on our site!
